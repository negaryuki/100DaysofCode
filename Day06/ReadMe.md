# Reeborg's World Maze Solver

## Overview

Welcome to my Reeborg's World Maze Solver repository! On Day 6 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I took on the challenge of solving the maze in Reeborg's World, where the robot spins at every move, and the goal is to reach the flag without hitting the walls. Additionally, I also tackled Hurdle 1 to 4 challenges.

## Project Description

In this project, I utilized while loops in Reeborg's World to navigate the robot through the maze and complete the Hurdle challenges. The robot's movement is constrained by the maze walls, and it must follow a specific path (following the right side, in this case) to reach the flag successfully.

## Learning Highlights

Throughout the process of solving these challenges, I gained valuable insights into several key concepts:

- Understanding the functionality of while loops, which repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition is true.
- Differentiating when to use for loops (for iterating through items in a list) and while loops (for executing code until a specific condition is met).
- Utilizing indentation for code blocks and learning about the debate over using tabs versus spaces.
- Nesting if statements within while loops to create conditional actions based on the robot's position and surroundings.
- Creating functions to organize code blocks and improve code reusability.

Feel free to explore the solutions for each challenge and experiment with different approaches.

## Project Insights

Solving these challenges was both fun and challenging. The maze problem required careful planning and logic to ensure the robot followed the correct path. Navigating the robot through the maze while avoiding collisions with the walls tested my understanding of loops and conditional statements.

## Next Steps

I plan to continue exploring more challenges and projects in Reeborg's World to further enhance my programming skills. Additionally, I will continue my journey into Python and explore other areas of programming and problem-solving.

## Acknowledgments

I am grateful for the Reeborg's World platform for providing an interactive and engaging environment to practice coding concepts. Special thanks to the "100 Days of Code" challenge for keeping me motivated and determined on my coding journey.
