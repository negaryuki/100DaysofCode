#Day No.2

#Data Types:
# 1. Strings -> "Hello" / Characters => print("World"[0])  =>> W / anything inside "" is considered as a string
print("Hello" [4])

# 2. Integer -> Numbers without decimals / 1234 /
# for dividing numbers with a comma use _ e.g. 123_456_000 is : 123,4456,000
print(123 + 456)
print(123_345_567)

# 3. Floats -> Numbers with decimals / 123.34

# 4. Boolean -> True / False

# In order to check the type of our data we can use the function => type()

# whenever you divide a number the result will be a "float"
# In order to "power" numbers we use => **

a = print(2**3)

#Priorities in mathematics
# PEMDAS

# Parentheses ()
# Exponents **
# Multiplication *
# Division /
# Addition +
# Subtraction -

print(3*(3+3)/3-3)

#Rounding numbers => print(8//3) will result in an integer rather than a float
# using round(number, number of decimals) will result in a round number

print(8/3)

print(8//3)

print(round(8/3))
print(round(8/3,2))

# continue calculating: we can simplify the code by writing a/= 2

result=4/2
result /=2

result **= 3

print(result)
