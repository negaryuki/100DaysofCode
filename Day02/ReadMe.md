# Tip Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to my Tip Calculator repository! On Day 2 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I created a simple calculator that helps you split the total bill and calculate the tip based on the percentage you want to give.

## Project Description

In this project, I developed a user-friendly tip calculator using Python. The calculator takes input for the total bill amount, the percentage of tip you want to give, and the number of people to split the bill with. It then calculates the tip amount for each person and the total amount that each person needs to pay.

## Learning Highlights

During the development of this calculator, I gained valuable insights into the following key learning points:

- Utilizing f-strings for string formatting, which proved to be a convenient and efficient way to format output messages.
- Handling user input, converting strings to float or integer data types for numerical calculations.
- Rounding off calculated results to a specified decimal number using the `round()` function.

## How to Use the Tip Calculator

To use the Tip Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python script `main.py` in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
3. Run the script, and the calculator will prompt you to enter the total bill amount, the percentage of tip you want to give, and the number of people splitting the bill.
4. The calculator will then display the tip amount for each person and the total amount each person needs to pay, including the tip.

Feel free to use the Tip Calculator whenever you need to split a bill and calculate the tip for a group of people! :D

## Project Insights

Creating the Tip Calculator was a practical exercise that helped me improve my skills in handling user input and performing calculations in Python. The use of f-strings for formatted output made the calculator's output more user-friendly and readable.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the resources that provided insights into string formatting, handling user input, and numerical calculations in Python. Special thanks to the "100 Days of Code" challenge for keeping me motivated and dedicated to my coding progress.

Note: Customize this README file further to add any additional details about the Tip Calculator's features, calculations, or the specific way in which user input is handled. You may also include examples of different tip percentage inputs and the corresponding outputs for reference. Additionally, consider adding screenshots or examples of the calculator's output to provide a visual representation of the calculations.
