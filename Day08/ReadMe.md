# Encryption and Decryption Program

## Overview

Welcome to my encryption and decryption program! This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey, and on Day 8, I've built a Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt their input based on a shift value. The program utilizes various concepts learned in the past few days, such as functions, loops, if-else statements, and more.

## How it Works

The program takes user input and prompts them to choose between encryption or decryption. Based on their selection, the program applies a shift to each character in the input string, effectively moving the alphabet forwards or backward. This shift acts as the encryption key. To decrypt the encoded word, the user must enter the same shift value used for encryption.

**Example:**
- To encrypt: Word = "hello", shift = 5 > Encoded word = "mjqqt" (shifted 5 alphabets backward)
- To decrypt: Word = "mjqqt", shift = 5 (same shift amount) > Decoded word = "hello"

## Learning Highlights

During the implementation of this project, I reinforced my understanding of various Python concepts:

- Utilizing functions for modular code and improving code readability.
- Applying if-else statements to create condition-based actions for encryption or decryption.
- Implementing while loops and for loops for iterative processes.
- Understanding the concept of modulo "%" to handle cyclic shifts during encryption.
- Importing variables from another file (in this case, ASCII art) to enhance the program's aesthetics.
- Learning about parameters and arguments, functions with multiple inputs, and the differences between positional and keyword arguments.

## How to Run the Program

To use this encryption and decryption program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python script in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
3. Run the script, and the program will prompt you for input and shift values for encryption or decryption.

Feel free to explore the code, review it multiple times, and make modifications as needed. I hope this project helps you solidify your understanding of Python concepts and brings you one step closer to achieving your coding goals!
