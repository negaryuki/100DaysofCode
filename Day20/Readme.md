# Snake Game - A Slithering Adventure


Welcome to my Snake Game project, a thrilling coding journey. This project marks Day 20 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Key Concepts Explored

Throughout this project, I delved into several crucial concepts, honing my coding skills:

- **Screen Setup and Creating a Snake Body:** Setting up the game screen and initializing the snake's body were the initial steps in creating a captivating gaming environment.

- **Animating the Snake Segments on Screen:** The heart of the game is in its animation. I ensured smooth movement and captivating visuals as the snake navigates the screen.

- **Create a Snake Class & Move to OOP:** The transition to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brought structure and clarity to the code. I created a Snake Class to encapsulate the game's logic and functionalities.

- **How to Control the Snake with a Keypress:** Making the game interactive is key. I implemented control mechanisms to allow players to guide the snake's path with keyboard inputs.
