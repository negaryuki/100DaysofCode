# Morse Code Converter

This Python program converts a user-provided string into Morse code. It takes any string input and converts it into its Morse code equivalent using a predefined dictionary mapping characters to Morse code representations.

## What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. It was originally developed for use in telegraphy between electrical telegraphs. Each character is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes. For example, the letter "A" is represented as ".-" and the letter "B" is represented as "-...".

## Features

- Converts any string input into Morse code.
- Handles uppercase letters, digits, and some common punctuation marks.
- Raises a custom error if a character in the input string is not found in the Morse code dictionary.
- Allows the user to enter a new string if an error is encountered.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/morse-code-converter.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd morse-code-converter
    ```

3. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python morse_code_converter.py
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter a string. The program will then display the Morse code representation of the input string.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter a string: Hello World!
Morse code representation: .... . .-.. .-.. ---   .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.--
```
