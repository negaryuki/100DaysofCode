# Hangman Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Hangman Game repository! This project was completed on Day 7 of my 100 Days of Code challenge. The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where the user has limited chances to guess a secret word.

## Project Description

In this Hangman Game, the user must guess a word chosen randomly from a predefined list. The user's objective is to reveal the entire word by guessing individual letters, one at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn, and the user loses one of their limited chances. The game continues until the user guesses the entire word or runs out of chances.

## Learning Highlights

During the development of this project, I learned and applied the following concepts:

- Importing modules to leverage existing functionalities in Python.
- Importing lists and variables from other files into the main script.
- Applying while and for loops for iterative processes in the game.
- Understanding the importance of proper indentation and logic flow in programming.
- Utilizing the "in" keyword to check if a letter is present in the secret word.

## How to Play

To play the Hangman Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python script `main.py` in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
3. Run the script, and the game will randomly select a word from the predefined list.
4. Enter a letter as your guess. The game will display the correct letters guessed so far.
5. Continue guessing letters until you reveal the entire word or run out of chances.

## Project Challenges and Review

Building the Hangman Game involved several challenges, such as designing the logic for word selection, user input validation, and drawing the hangman figure step-by-step. However, through careful iteration and focus on the code structure, I successfully completed the game.

I reviewed the code multiple times to ensure it is bug-free, user-friendly, and adheres to best coding practices.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my appreciation to the coding community and various online resources that provided guidance and inspiration throughout my Hangman Game development. Special thanks to the "100 Days of Code" challenge for keeping me motivated and committed to my coding journey.
