# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissors Game repository! On Day 4 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I created a simple rock-paper-scissors game using Python. The game allows the user to play against the computer, which generates its move randomly using the `random.choice()` function.

## Project Description

In this project, I implemented a classic rock-paper-scissors game where the user and the computer choose their moves. The computer's move is randomly generated from a list of available moves. The user's move is taken as input, and the winner is determined based on the game's rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

## Learning Highlights

During the development of this game, I gained insights into several key concepts and Python functionalities:

- Understanding the flexibility of lists and using various list operations, such as extending the list, replacing items, choosing specific items with indices, and handling nested lists.
- Reviewing if/elif/else statements and utilizing nested if statements for complex conditions.
- Learning about the `random` module in Python and differentiating between `random.randint()`, `random.random()`, and `random.choice()` functions.
- Being mindful of index errors when working with lists and ensuring appropriate indexing (index starting from 0 for front and -1 for back).

## How to Play

To play the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python script `main.py` in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
3. Run the script, and the game will prompt you to choose your move (rock, paper, or scissors).
4. The computer will randomly generate its move.
5. The winner of the round will be displayed based on the game rules.

Feel free to play multiple rounds and enjoy the simple yet entertaining game!

## Project Insights

Creating the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game was an exciting learning experience, especially exploring the different functionalities of lists and the `random` module. Handling user input and applying game rules within if statements provided valuable practice in logic building.
