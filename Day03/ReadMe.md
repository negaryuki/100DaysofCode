# Treasure Island Adventure

## Overview

Welcome to my Treasure Island Adventure repository! On Day 3 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I created an interactive storytelling game where each step you take leads to different outcomes on a thrilling treasure hunt.

## Project Description

In this project, I developed an exciting treasure island adventure using Python. The game takes you on a journey where you make choices at each step, leading to various outcomes and decisions. Your goal is to find the hidden treasure on the island.

## Learning Highlights

During the development of this adventure game, I focused on the following key learning points:

- Understanding the use of if/elif/else statements to create conditional branches based on user choices.
- Implementing nested if/elif/else statements to handle complex decision-making scenarios.
- Realizing the significance of proper indentation in Python for correct code execution.
- Exploring the use of ASCII art to enhance the storytelling and create figures using numbers and symbols.

## How to Play

To start your Treasure Island Adventure, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python script `main.py` in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
3. Run the script, and the game will present you with choices at each step.
4. Make your choices wisely, as they will determine the outcome of your adventure.
5. Navigate through the story, solve puzzles, and try to find the hidden treasure!

Feel free to replay the game and explore different paths and outcomes!

## Project Insights

Developing the Treasure Island Adventure was a fun and engaging experience. Writing the interactive story and creating different paths based on user choices allowed for creative thinking and logical decision-making.

## Next Steps

As I continue my coding journey, I plan to expand this adventure game further by adding more complex storylines, additional puzzles, and unique challenges. I also aim to improve the user experience and storytelling elements.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the resources that provided ASCII art and inspired my use of it in the game. Special thanks to the "100 Days of Code" challenge for keeping me motivated and committed to my coding progress.
