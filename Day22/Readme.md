# Pong Game - A Classic Arcade Experience


Welcome to my Pong Game project, a coding adventure that brings the classic arcade game to life. This project was developed as part of my coding journey, specifically on Day 22 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Key Concepts Explored

In this project, I delved into various key concepts of game development and programming:

- **Create a Paddle that responds to Key Presses:** I crafted responsive paddles that react to player input, allowing for smooth and intuitive gameplay.

- **Write the Paddle Class and Create the Second Paddle:** The Paddle Class was carefully designed to manage paddle movement and interactions. Additionally, I implemented a second paddle for exciting two-player action.

- **Write the Ball Class and Make the Ball Move:** The Ball Class was created to bring life to the game. I ensured that the ball moves dynamically within the game environment.

- **Add the Ball Bouncing Logic:** To maintain the dynamics of the game, I implemented intelligent ball bouncing logic, ensuring that it behaves realistically when hitting paddles and boundaries.

- **Detect Collisions with the Paddle:** Robust collision detection with paddles was crucial for a satisfying gaming experience. I tackled this challenge with precision.

- **Detect when the Ball goes Out of Bounds:** Implementing bounds detection ensures that the game can accurately track when the ball goes out of play.

- **Score Keeping and Changing the Ball Speed:** Keeping score is essential for competitive play, and I integrated a scoring system. Additionally, I provided a feature to adjust the ball's speed, adding an element of challenge.
